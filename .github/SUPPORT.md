## Timezone Butler doesn't translate the time

Make sure you invited the bot in the channel. If it still doesn't translate, that might be a bug and you should open an [issue](https://github.com/mathieudutour/timezone-butler/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+missed+time&template=missed-time.md&title=).
